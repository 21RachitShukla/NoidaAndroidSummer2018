    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    BB:43:CF:53:75:FF:03:B8:94:77:C9:B9:EF:12:66:F7:3B:C5:4F:76

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    string in this file.
